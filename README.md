# Project_TNP

## Overview

Project_TNP is a collection of graphing tools designed to provide stock trading suggestions. The earlier versions (0.1 to 1.2) are deprecated and not functional, as they were based on a flawed approach using percentages instead of actual graph data.

The latest versions, named TNP-graphing, implement a more effective strategy using Short Moving Average (Short MA) and Long Moving Average (Long MA). This strategy involves analyzing two moving averagesâ€”one calculated over a shorter time period and the other over a longer time period. The tools generate two additional graphs based on these averages. When the graphs intersect from one angle, it suggests a buying opportunity, and when they intersect from the other angle, it suggests a selling opportunity.

## Features

- Short MA and Long MA strategy for stock trading
- Graphing tools for visual representation
- Buy/sell suggestions based on moving average intersections

## Version History

- **v0.1 - v1.2:** Deprecated versions using a percentage-based approach.
- **v2.0 (TNP-graphing):** Implementing Short MA and Long MA strategy.
- **v2.4 (TNP-flask):** Mostly just trying out the flask library(*module* or whatever is it called)

## Disclaimer

These tools provide suggestions based on historical data and moving averages. It's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider other factors before making any financial decisions. The creators of Project_TNP(just me) are not responsible for any losses made through the use of these tools.

Feel free to contribute to the project and enhance its features.
