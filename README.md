# Project_TNP

## Overview

Project_TNP is a collection of graphing tools designed to provide stock trading suggestions. The earlier versions (0.1 to 1.2) are deprecated and not functional, as they were based on a flawed approach using percentages instead of actual graph data.

The latest versions, named TNP-graphing, implement a more effective strategy using Short Moving Average (Short MA) and Long Moving Average (Long MA). This strategy involves analyzing two moving averagesâ€”one calculated over a shorter time period and the other over a longer time period. The tools generate two additional graphs based on these averages. When the graphs intersect from one angle, it suggests a buying opportunity, and when they intersect from the other angle, it suggests a selling opportunity.

## Features

- Short MA and Long MA strategy for stock trading
- Graphing tools for visual representation
- Buy/sell suggestions based on moving average intersections

## Version History

- **v0.1 - v1.2:** Deprecated versions using a percentage-based approach.
- **v2.0 (TNP-graphing):** Implementing Short MA and Long MA strategy.
